# Contributing

## Workflow
1. Create a branch from `development`.
2. Keep commits focused and small.
3. Run `npm run build` before opening a PR.
4. Open a PR into `development`.

## Branches
- `main`: stable release history
- `development`: integration branch
- `qa`: testing and verification
- `release`: pre-production candidate
